To run the NetworkGen, use following command:
./run1.sh arg1 arg2 arg3
where:
arg1 is input file to set environment
arg2 is the units of time to simulate from beginning
arg3 is the time
For example:
./run1.sh SocialNetworkEnv.inp -y 5
This runs the simulation for 5 years
./run1.sh SocialNetworkEnv.inp -d 100
This runs the simulation for 100 days
Possible choices for argument 2 are: -d (days), -y (years), -h (hours), -m (minutes), -s (seconds) and -w (weeks)

To run the Gyani, simply use the command:
./run2.sh
